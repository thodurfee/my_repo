no "\n" in any nammes, it will break the ability to switch to a new line in a .txt editor later

authors should be entered in the same cell, with a ";" seperator. If you use "," the csv reader will skip over second and third authors later


define your git reporistory and project name beforehand, it makes things easier

instructions:
run 99 wrapper from the initialization file first 



Next, I should make a folder that is set up to acept git branch committ histories


then, I need to check how to recursivelty update folders in git. do I need tpo go into every file and make an init?
that seems unlikelty


ifpossible, I should see if I can make a unix log file for this set up code.



folders I and E may be redundant. What is the difference?


my git nickname should be in the 03 input git settings file


for some reason, in 01 git update.txt , when I type the sed command on line 22 into the terminal, I get the activity I want, the replacement of the run count from the meta.csv file

but when I try to run the same code in a script with globals for values instead of hard coded numbers, it fails.


Go back to the labor project and seee what I did to increment
	also, see if my awk / grep / sed commands from the labor project apply here, they should



after I update that, consider merging folders I and E

for the commit history, remember to track the run count,
either try and change the format into 0001   0002   style
or
see if commits and branch names canhave a . in them and just use 0.0001 0.0002 as substitutes


also, start going through each file and add the comments for the file


start referring ot the comments in this read me file

start giving this read me structure


talk to Man Xu about her norms for coding
we are probably going to work toggehter for this project


If I am full time, that is fine.



Start thinking about what the final product is going to look like
