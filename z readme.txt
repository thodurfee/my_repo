no "\n" in any nammes, it will break the ability to switch to a new line in a .txt editor later

authors should be entered in the same cell, with a ";" seperator. If you use "," the csv reader will skip over second and third authors later


define your git reporistory and project name beforehand, it makes things easier


run 04 to begin initialization
run 05 to begin git stuff



it's starting to break, come back when I am fresh



First, I need to add a folder to keep track of all of the git branch commits.
I know that this will be in git, but I should have a version in my repository in case there is bad wifi


Second, I need to figure out why folders I and J keep hiding from unix and git


then, I need to check how to recursivelty update folders in git. do I need tpo go into every file and make an init?
that seems unlikelty


ifpossible, I should see if I can make a unix log file for this set up code.


also, folders D and J may be redundant. what non git settings do i need? be specific

folders I and E may be redundant. What is the difference?


my git nickname should be in the 03 input git settings file
